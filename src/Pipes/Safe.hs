{-| This module provides an orphan 'MonadCatch' instance for 'Proxy' of the
    form:

> instance (MonadCatch m, MonadIO m) => MonadCatch (Proxy a' a b' b m) where

    ... so you can throw and catch exceptions within pipes using all
    'MonadCatch' operations.

    This module also provides generalized versions of some 'MonadCatch'
    operations so that you can also protect against premature termination of
    connected components.  For example, if you protect a 'readFile' computation
    using 'bracket' from this module:

> -- readFile.hs
> import Pipes
> import qualified Pipes.Prelude as P
> import Pipes.Safe
> import qualified System.IO as IO
> import Prelude hiding (readFile)
>
> readFile :: FilePath -> Producer' String (SafeT IO) ()
> readFile file = bracket
>     (do h <- IO.openFile file IO.ReadMode
>         putStrLn $ "{" ++ file ++ " open}"
>         return h )
>     (\h -> do
>         IO.hClose h
>         putStrLn $ "{" ++ file ++ " closed}" )
>     (\h -> hoist lift (P.fromHandle h))

    ... then this generalized 'bracket' will guard against both exceptions and
    premature termination of other pipes:

>>> runSafeT $ run $ readFile "readFile.hs" >-> P.take 4 >-> hoist lift P.stdout
{readFile.hs open}
-- readFile.hs
import Pipes
import qualified Pipes.Prelude as P
import Pipes.Safe
{readFile.hs closed}

    Note that the 'MonadCatch' instance for 'Proxy' provides weaker versions of
    'mask' and 'uninterruptibleMask' that do not completely prevent asynchronous
    exceptions.  Instead, they provide a weaker guarantee that asynchronous
    exceptions will only occur during 'Pipes.await's or 'Pipes.yield's and
    nowhere else.  For example, if you write:

> mask_ $ do
>     x <- await
>     lift $ print xs
>     lift $ print x

    ... then you may receive an asynchronous exception during the 'Pipes.await',
    but you will not receive an asynchronous exception during or in between the
    two 'print' statements.  This weaker guarantee suffices to provide
    asynchronous exception safety.
